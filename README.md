![TOP10 Logo](TOP10_logo_256.png)

**Monad Meme Top 10 Index (TOP10)** is an immutable, ownerless ERC-20 index token representing a fixed basket of ten leading meme assets on the Monad network at genesis.

TOP10 is designed to provide transparent, trust-minimized exposure to the early Monad meme ecosystem through a fully on-chain Net Asset Value (NAV) mechanism.

## Key Properties

- **Immutable & Ownerless**  
  No admin keys, no governance, no upgrade mechanism.

- **Fixed Basket**  
  The index composition and weights are permanently locked.

- **Permissionless Mint & Redeem**  
  Anyone can mint by supplying the underlying assets or redeem TOP10 back into the basket at NAV.

- **Market-Driven Pricing**  
  Secondary market pricing is handled via decentralized liquidity pools, with mint/redeem arbitrage enforcing NAV.

## How It Works (High Level)

- Each TOP10 token represents an equal-weight share of 10 underlying meme assets.
- Minting requires supplying the proportional amounts of each constituent token.
- Redeeming burns TOP10 and returns the underlying assets proportionally.
- No rebalance, no intervention — the index is a permanent snapshot.
